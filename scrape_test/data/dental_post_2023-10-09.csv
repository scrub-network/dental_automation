You enjoy seeing your patient regularly and the ability to diagnose them and give them the treatment they need without being dictated by quotas. You enjoy the autonomy you get from a private practice but want someone else to oversee the business, marketing, and managing the day-to-day logistics. You would rather see more patients than paperwork.

MINT is a family-owned, dentist-run company whose values of love, generosity, and perfection flow from the leadership down to create an atmosphere where employees feel inspired, supported, and equipped to perform to the best of their ability. We allow our dentists the autonomy they want to enable them to make the right decisions for each patient (no quotas here). They donât have leadership looking over their shoulder, and they have support from other highly qualified colleagues to collaborate with and learn from to help build their expertise. Our commitment to only hiring the best staff and utilizing only high-tech equipment has helped us earn tens of thousands of 5-star reviews. We take care of the business, so our dentists have the time to give their full attention to more patients, changing their lives, one smile at a time.

I own 50% of the practice with another doctor. Over the last twelve months I have personally collected $600,000. Our overhead ranges between 50-60% every month. Therefore I made a little less than $300,000 over the last twelve months.

The doctors own 100% of the practice. There is no outside ownership from a DSO. Comfort Dental is a franchise, meaning we pay a small fee every month to get the advantages of being part of a larger group (for example, discounted supplies and lab fees, etc.), while still being able to own 100% of the practice ourselves. If you are interested in learning more about Comfort Dental as a franchise, go to https://comfortdental.com/franchise. 

This is a great office with a great staff, and good potential for growth. Every year has been better than the last since Covid, so you can expect to make more than my average in the next twelve months.

The office is well run. We collected 98% of our production over the last year, so there is very little wasted work. You get paid for what you do. We see an average of 60-70 new patients every month. 

I am pricing it lower than its value because I need to move out west to be closer to family for personal reasons as soon as possible. This is a very good deal for a partnership buy-in. If you are worried about procuring the funds for a buy-in, we do have a bank we work with that we can direct you to, if needed.

The other doctor at the practice, Dr. McCormick, has been practicing for almost 20 years. He is a great partner. He loves to mentor and will be a huge resource for any dentist wanting to get better and faster at dentistry.

The office is loaded with toys; 3D CBCT, lab grade milling machine (can even cut titanium for custom abutments), digital impressions, 3D printer, tissue laser, etc.  

We train associates on the Nobel guided implant placement/restoration system (my associate in McKinney with no prior implant experience has placed over 60 implants in his first 8 months).  This is a great office to be in! You would be working alongside the owner, Dr. William Nguyen.  Heand#39;s looking to scale back his workflow and allow an associate to take over the schedule for the most part.  Heand#39;s typically there Mon-Thursday to mentor and do larger cases.

WIDE range of services offered; everything from pedo to All-on-Fours and everything in-between.  PPO and FFS only!  We also have an amazing hygienist at that office.  And our lead assistant has been with us for nearly a decade.

Iand#39;m looking for a dentist that will treat the office as their own, but also open to being mentored by Dr. Nguyen.  We will allow a lot of freedom on how you work, treatment plan, etc.  Weand#39;re NOT corporate.

An added bonus, I do not require a time constrained contract. I feel like our relationship should be a mutual one. I want you to be happy and WANT to be here, as opposed to having to be here. :)  We care VERY MUCH about quality dentistry. We treatment plan patients like family. And, we warranty most of our work.  Please respond here, or via text or email (see below), to schedule an interview.

The office location is: 8404 Preston Rd, Plano (near Masala Wok and Pei Wei, in a great and busy shopping center).

I do however conduct the initial interview out of my office in McKinney: 4610 Eldorado Pkwy, McKinney.

Lastly, I will be out of town from Oct 1-7th so I will not have access to my office phone or email during that time.
