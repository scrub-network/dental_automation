Mortenson Dental Partners is one of the largest groups of employee-owned dental practices in the United States, with over 140 practices across nine states, over 1,800 team members and nearly one million patient visits each year. Unlike most dental support organizations, we are completely employee owned, with absolutely no private equity. Each location feels like a private practice but enjoys the support of a large organization. We empower our team members to think like owners and make the best decisions for their team, patients and practice.
Our values were built on a foundation of love for one another, regardless of race, color, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, religion or other attributes. We are committed to a workplace that fully represents the communities we serve as we live our four core values — caring for everyone, expressing gratitude, sharing abundantly and building relationships.

We are looking for passionate and dedicated general practice dentists who love creating long-lasting relationships with their patients. As a general dentist with Mortenson Dental Partners, you’ll have clinical autonomy along with a wealth of benefits.

Our general dentists earn an average of $230,000, with some earning over $400,000 — there is really no limit to your earning potential!  You’ll also immediately be an owner in our organization through our employee stock ownership plan and, if you choose, through any direct stock you purchase. You can take pride in joining an organization that prioritizes clinical quality in all decision-making, utilizing the expertise of an esteemed and expansive Clinical Committee. As a dentist, you will get the support, mentoring and guidance needed to provide excellent care for your patients and growth in your career.  And, to help make the transition easier, we’re offering a minimum sign-on bonus of $20,000.
 
Join an amazing community. Located on the Missouri River, South Sioux City is a growing town of nearly 15,000 residents. It offers convenient access to larger metropolitan areas in three states — Nebraska, South Dakota and Iowa. South Sioux has a rich Native American heritage, and is your gateway to two scenic byways that pay homage to America’s history: the Lewis and Clark Scenic Byway and the Outlaw Trail.

Unlike most dental support organizations, we are completely employee owned, with absolutely no private equity. Each location feels like a private practice but enjoys the support of a large organization. We empower our team members to think like owners and make the best decisions for their team, patients and practice.
Our values were built on a foundation of love for one another, regardless of race, color, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, religion or other attributes. We are committed to a workplace that fully represents the communities we serve as we live our four core values — caring for everyone, expressing gratitude, sharing abundantly and building relationships.
 
About the Position
We are looking for passionate and dedicated general practice dentists who love creating long-lasting relationships with their patients. As a general dentist with Mortenson Dental Partners, you’ll have clinical autonomy along with a wealth of benefits. These include free internal clinical education classes on a variety of dental specialties, such as clear aligners, dental implants, endodontics and more! As a new provider, you’ll enjoy a period of guaranteed income as you settle into your practice, followed by 30% of net collections. Our general dentists earn an average of $230,000, with some earning over $400,000 — there is really no limit to your earning potential!  You’ll also immediately be an owner in our organization through our employee stock ownership plan and, if you choose, through any direct stock you purchase. You can take pride in joining an organization that prioritizes clinical quality in all decision-making, utilizing the expertise of an esteemed and expansive Clinical Committee. As a dentist, you will get the support, mentoring and guidance needed to provide excellent care for your patients and growth in your career.  And, to help make the transition easier, we’re offering a minimum sign-on bonus of $20,000.

18185948,"South Sioux City, Nebraska, United States",Nebraska,2023-09-26,Mortenson Dental Partners,Permanent/Full-Time,,"About the Company
Mortenson Dental Partners is one of the largest groups of employee-owned dental practices in the United States, with over 140 practices across nine states, over 1,800 team members and nearly one million patient visits each year. Unlike most dental support organizations, we are completely employee owned, with absolutely no private equity. Each location feels like a private practice but enjoys the support of a large organization. We empower our team members to think like owners and make the best decisions for their team, patients and practice.
Our values were built on a foundation of love for one another, regardless of race, color, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, religion or other attributes. We are committed to a workplace that fully represents the communities we serve as we live our four core values — caring for everyone, expressing gratitude, sharing abundantly and building relationships.
 
About the Position
We are looking for passionate and dedicated general practice dentists who love creating long-lasting relationships with their patients. As a general dentist with Mortenson Dental Partners, you’ll have clinical autonomy along with a wealth of benefits. These include free internal clinical education classes on a variety of dental specialties, such as clear aligners, dental implants, endodontics and more! As a new provider, you’ll enjoy a period of guaranteed income as you settle into your practice, followed by 30% of net collections. Our general dentists earn an average of $230,000, with some earning over $400,000 — there is really no limit to your earning potential!  You’ll also immediately be an owner in our organization through our employee stock ownership plan and, if you choose, through any direct stock you purchase. You can take pride in joining an organization that prioritizes clinical quality in all decision-making, utilizing the expertise of an esteemed and expansive Clinical Committee. As a dentist, you will get the support, mentoring and guidance needed to provide excellent care for your patients and growth in your career.  And, to help make the transition easier, we’re offering a minimum sign-on bonus of $20,000.
 
Join an amazing community. Located on the Missouri River, South Sioux City is a growing town of nearly 15,000 residents. It offers convenient access to larger metropolitan areas in three states — Nebraska, South Dakota and Iowa. South Sioux has a rich Native American heritage, and is your gateway to two scenic byways that pay homage to America’s history: the Lewis and Clark Scenic Byway and the Outlaw Trail. For the outdoor enthusiast, it is home to numerous city and state parks as well as the 20-mile Al Bengtson Bike Trail. Take your career on a new adventure and call South Sioux City home!

Mortenson Dental Partners is one of the largest groups of employee-owned dental practices in the United States, with over 140 practices across nine states, over 1,800 team members and nearly one million patient visits each year. Unlike most dental support organizations, we are completely employee owned, with absolutely no private equity. Each location feels like a private practice but enjoys the support of a large organization. We empower our team members to think like owners and make the best decisions for their team, patients and practice.
Our values were built on a foundation of love for one another, regardless of race, color, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, religion or other attributes. We are committed to a workplace that fully represents the communities we serve as we live our four core values — caring for everyone, expressing gratitude, sharing abundantly and building relationships.

We are looking for passionate and dedicated general practice dentists who love creating long-lasting relationships with their patients. As a general dentist with Mortenson Dental Partners, you’ll have clinical autonomy along with a wealth of benefits.

Our general dentists earn an average of $230,000, with some earning over $400,000 — there is really no limit to your earning potential!  You’ll also immediately be an owner in our organization through our employee stock ownership plan and, if you choose, through any direct stock you purchase. You can take pride in joining an organization that prioritizes clinical quality in all decision-making, utilizing the expertise of an esteemed and expansive Clinical Committee. As a dentist, you will get the support, mentoring and guidance needed to provide excellent care for your patients and growth in your career.  And, to help make the transition easier, we’re offering a minimum sign-on bonus of $20,000.
 
Join an amazing community. Located on the Missouri River, South Sioux City is a growing town of nearly 15,000 residents. It offers convenient access to larger metropolitan areas in three states — Nebraska, South Dakota and Iowa. South Sioux has a rich Native American heritage, and is your gateway to two scenic byways that pay homage to America’s history: the Lewis and Clark Scenic Byway and the Outlaw Trail.

Mortenson Dental Partners is one of the largest groups of employee-owned dental practices in the United States, with over 140 practices across nine states, over 1,800 team members and nearly one million patient visits each year. Unlike most dental support organizations, we are completely employee owned, with absolutely no private equity. Each location feels like a private practice but enjoys the support of a large organization. We empower our team members to think like owners and make the best decisions for their team, patients and practice.
Our values were built on a foundation of love for one another, regardless of race, color, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, religion or other attributes. We are committed to a workplace that fully represents the communities we serve as we live our four core values — caring for everyone, expressing gratitude, sharing abundantly and building relationships.
 
About the Position
We are looking for passionate and dedicated general practice dentists who love creating long-lasting relationships with their patients. As a general dentist with Mortenson Dental Partners, you’ll have clinical autonomy along with a wealth of benefits. These include free internal clinical education classes on a variety of dental specialties, such as clear aligners, dental implants, endodontics and more! As a new provider, you’ll enjoy a period of guaranteed income as you settle into your practice, followed by 30% of net collections. Our general dentists earn an average of $230,000, with some earning over $400,000 — there is really no limit to your earning potential!  You’ll also immediately be an owner in our organization through our employee stock ownership plan and, if you choose, through any direct stock you purchase. You can take pride in joining an organization that prioritizes clinical quality in all decision-making, utilizing the expertise of an esteemed and expansive Clinical Committee. As a dentist, you will get the support, mentoring and guidance needed to provide excellent care for your patients and growth in your career.  And, to help make the transition easier, we’re offering a minimum sign-on bonus of $20,000.

18185948,"South Sioux City, Nebraska, United States",Nebraska,2023-09-26,Mortenson Dental Partners,Permanent/Full-Time,,"About the Company
Mortenson Dental Partners is one of the largest groups of employee-owned dental practices in the United States, with over 140 practices across nine states, over 1,800 team members and nearly one million patient visits each year. Unlike most dental support organizations, we are completely employee owned, with absolutely no private equity. Each location feels like a private practice but enjoys the support of a large organization. We empower our team members to think like owners and make the best decisions for their team, patients and practice.
Our values were built on a foundation of love for one another, regardless of race, color, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, religion or other attributes. We are committed to a workplace that fully represents the communities we serve as we live our four core values — caring for everyone, expressing gratitude, sharing abundantly and building relationships.
 
About the Position
We are looking for passionate and dedicated general practice dentists who love creating long-lasting relationships with their patients. As a general dentist with Mortenson Dental Partners, you’ll have clinical autonomy along with a wealth of benefits. These include free internal clinical education classes on a variety of dental specialties, such as clear aligners, dental implants, endodontics and more! As a new provider, you’ll enjoy a period of guaranteed income as you settle into your practice, followed by 30% of net collections. Our general dentists earn an average of $230,000, with some earning over $400,000 — there is really no limit to your earning potential!  You’ll also immediately be an owner in our organization through our employee stock ownership plan and, if you choose, through any direct stock you purchase. You can take pride in joining an organization that prioritizes clinical quality in all decision-making, utilizing the expertise of an esteemed and expansive Clinical Committee. As a dentist, you will get the support, mentoring and guidance needed to provide excellent care for your patients and growth in your career.  And, to help make the transition easier, we’re offering a minimum sign-on bonus of $20,000.
 
Join an amazing community. Located on the Missouri River, South Sioux City is a growing town of nearly 15,000 residents. It offers convenient access to larger metropolitan areas in three states — Nebraska, South Dakota and Iowa. South Sioux has a rich Native American heritage, and is your gateway to two scenic byways that pay homage to America’s history: the Lewis and Clark Scenic Byway and the Outlaw Trail. For the outdoor enthusiast, it is home to numerous city and state parks as well as the 20-mile Al Bengtson Bike Trail. Take your career on a new adventure and call South Sioux City home!

Mortenson Dental Partners is one of the largest groups of employee-owned dental practices in the United States, with over 140 practices across nine states, over 1,800 team members and nearly one million patient visits each year. Unlike most dental support organizations, we are completely employee owned, with absolutely no private equity. Each location feels like a private practice but enjoys the support of a large organization. We empower our team members to think like owners and make the best decisions for their team, patients and practice.
Our values were built on a foundation of love for one another, regardless of race, color, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, religion or other attributes. We are committed to a workplace that fully represents the communities we serve as we live our four core values — caring for everyone, expressing gratitude, sharing abundantly and building relationships.

We are looking for passionate and dedicated general practice dentists who love creating long-lasting relationships with their patients. As a general dentist with Mortenson Dental Partners, you’ll have clinical autonomy along with a wealth of benefits.

Our general dentists earn an average of $230,000, with some earning over $400,000 — there is really no limit to your earning potential!  You’ll also immediately be an owner in our organization through our employee stock ownership plan and, if you choose, through any direct stock you purchase. You can take pride in joining an organization that prioritizes clinical quality in all decision-making, utilizing the expertise of an esteemed and expansive Clinical Committee. As a dentist, you will get the support, mentoring and guidance needed to provide excellent care for your patients and growth in your career.  And, to help make the transition easier, we’re offering a minimum sign-on bonus of $20,000.
 
Join an amazing community. Located on the Missouri River, South Sioux City is a growing town of nearly 15,000 residents. It offers convenient access to larger metropolitan areas in three states — Nebraska, South Dakota and Iowa. South Sioux has a rich Native American heritage, and is your gateway to two scenic byways that pay homage to America’s history: the Lewis and Clark Scenic Byway and the Outlaw Trail.

Mortenson Dental Partners is one of the largest groups of employee-owned dental practices in the United States, with over 140 practices across nine states, over 1,800 team members and nearly one million patient visits each year. Unlike most dental support organizations, we are completely employee owned, with absolutely no private equity. Each location feels like a private practice but enjoys the support of a large organization. We empower our team members to think like owners and make the best decisions for their team, patients and practice.
Our values were built on a foundation of love for one another, regardless of race, color, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, religion or other attributes. We are committed to a workplace that fully represents the communities we serve as we live our four core values — caring for everyone, expressing gratitude, sharing abundantly and building relationships.
 
About the Position
We are looking for passionate and dedicated general practice dentists who love creating long-lasting relationships with their patients. As a general dentist with Mortenson Dental Partners, you’ll have clinical autonomy along with a wealth of benefits. These include free internal clinical education classes on a variety of dental specialties, such as clear aligners, dental implants, endodontics and more! As a new provider, you’ll enjoy a period of guaranteed income as you settle into your practice, followed by 30% of net collections. Our general dentists earn an average of $230,000, with some earning over $400,000 — there is really no limit to your earning potential!  You’ll also immediately be an owner in our organization through our employee stock ownership plan and, if you choose, through any direct stock you purchase. You can take pride in joining an organization that prioritizes clinical quality in all decision-making, utilizing the expertise of an esteemed and expansive Clinical Committee. As a dentist, you will get the support, mentoring and guidance needed to provide excellent care for your patients and growth in your career.  And, to help make the transition easier, we’re offering a minimum sign-on bonus of $20,000.

18185948,"South Sioux City, Nebraska, United States",Nebraska,2023-09-26,Mortenson Dental Partners,Permanent/Full-Time,,"About the Company
Mortenson Dental Partners is one of the largest groups of employee-owned dental practices in the United States, with over 140 practices across nine states, over 1,800 team members and nearly one million patient visits each year. Unlike most dental support organizations, we are completely employee owned, with absolutely no private equity. Each location feels like a private practice but enjoys the support of a large organization. We empower our team members to think like owners and make the best decisions for their team, patients and practice.
Our values were built on a foundation of love for one another, regardless of race, color, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, religion or other attributes. We are committed to a workplace that fully represents the communities we serve as we live our four core values — caring for everyone, expressing gratitude, sharing abundantly and building relationships.
 
About the Position
We are looking for passionate and dedicated general practice dentists who love creating long-lasting relationships with their patients. As a general dentist with Mortenson Dental Partners, you’ll have clinical autonomy along with a wealth of benefits. These include free internal clinical education classes on a variety of dental specialties, such as clear aligners, dental implants, endodontics and more! As a new provider, you’ll enjoy a period of guaranteed income as you settle into your practice, followed by 30% of net collections. Our general dentists earn an average of $230,000, with some earning over $400,000 — there is really no limit to your earning potential!  You’ll also immediately be an owner in our organization through our employee stock ownership plan and, if you choose, through any direct stock you purchase. You can take pride in joining an organization that prioritizes clinical quality in all decision-making, utilizing the expertise of an esteemed and expansive Clinical Committee. As a dentist, you will get the support, mentoring and guidance needed to provide excellent care for your patients and growth in your career.  And, to help make the transition easier, we’re offering a minimum sign-on bonus of $20,000.
 
Join an amazing community. Located on the Missouri River, South Sioux City is a growing town of nearly 15,000 residents. It offers convenient access to larger metropolitan areas in three states — Nebraska, South Dakota and Iowa. South Sioux has a rich Native American heritage, and is your gateway to two scenic byways that pay homage to America’s history: the Lewis and Clark Scenic Byway and the Outlaw Trail. For the outdoor enthusiast, it is home to numerous city and state parks as well as the 20-mile Al Bengtson Bike Trail. Take your career on a new adventure and call South Sioux City home!

You can take pride in joining an organization that prioritizes clinical quality in all decision-making, utilizing the expertise of an esteemed and expansive Clinical Committee. As a dentist, you will get the support, mentoring and guidance needed to provide excellent care for your patients and growth in your career.  And, to help make the transition easier, we’re offering a minimum sign-on bonus of $20,000.

Mortenson Dental Partners is one of the largest groups of employee-owned dental practices in the United States, with over 140 practices across nine states, over 1,800 team members and nearly one million patient visits each year. Unlike most dental support organizations, we are completely employee owned, with absolutely no private equity. Each location feels like a private practice but enjoys the support of a large organization. We empower our team members to think like owners and make the best decisions for their team, patients and practice.
Our values were built on a foundation of love for one another, regardless of race, color, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, religion or other attributes. We are committed to a workplace that fully represents the communities we serve as we live our four core values — caring for everyone, expressing gratitude, sharing abundantly and building relationships.

Our general dentists earn an average of $230,000, with some earning over $400,000 — there is really no limit to your earning potential!  You’ll also immediately be an owner in our organization through our employee stock ownership plan and, if you choose, through any direct stock you purchase. You can take pride in joining an organization that prioritizes clinical quality in all decision-making, utilizing the expertise of an esteemed and expansive Clinical Committee. As a dentist, you will get the support, mentoring and guidance needed to provide excellent care for your patients and growth in your career.  And, to help make the transition easier, we’re offering a minimum sign-on bonus of $20,000.
 
Join an amazing community. Located on the Missouri River, South Sioux City is a growing town of nearly 15,000 residents. It offers convenient access to larger metropolitan areas in three states — Nebraska, South Dakota and Iowa. South Sioux has a rich Native American heritage, and is your gateway to two scenic byways that pay homage to America’s history: the Lewis and Clark Scenic Byway and the Outlaw Trail.

Unlike most dental support organizations, we are completely employee owned, with absolutely no private equity. Each location feels like a private practice but enjoys the support of a large organization. We empower our team members to think like owners and make the best decisions for their team, patients and practice.
Our values were built on a foundation of love for one another, regardless of race, color, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, religion or other attributes. We are committed to a workplace that fully represents the communities we serve as we live our four core values — caring for everyone, expressing gratitude, sharing abundantly and building relationships.
 
About the Position
We are looking for passionate and dedicated general practice dentists who love creating long-lasting relationships with their patients. As a general dentist with Mortenson Dental Partners, you’ll have clinical autonomy along with a wealth of benefits. These include free internal clinical education classes on a variety of dental specialties, such as clear aligners, dental implants, endodontics and more!

Mortenson Dental Partners is one of the largest groups of employee-owned dental practices in the United States, with over 140 practices across nine states, over 1,800 team members and nearly one million patient visits each year. Unlike most dental support organizations, we are completely employee owned, with absolutely no private equity. Each location feels like a private practice but enjoys the support of a large organization. We empower our team members to think like owners and make the best decisions for their team, patients and practice.
Our values were built on a foundation of love for one another, regardless of race, color, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, religion or other attributes. We are committed to a workplace that fully represents the communities we serve as we live our four core values — caring for everyone, expressing gratitude, sharing abundantly and building relationships.
 
About the Position
We are looking for passionate and dedicated general practice dentists who love creating long-lasting relationships with their patients. As a general dentist with Mortenson Dental Partners, you’ll have clinical autonomy along with a wealth of benefits. These include free internal clinical education classes on a variety of dental specialties, such as clear aligners, dental implants, endodontics and more! As a new provider, you’ll enjoy a period of guaranteed income as you settle into your practice, followed by 30% of net collections. Our general dentists earn an average of $230,000, with some earning over $400,000 — there is really no limit to your earning potential!  You’ll also immediately be an owner in our organization through our employee stock ownership plan and, if you choose, through any direct stock you purchase. You can take pride in joining an organization that prioritizes clinical quality in all decision-making, utilizing the expertise of an esteemed and expansive Clinical Committee. As a dentist, you will get the support, mentoring and guidance needed to provide excellent care for your patients and growth in your career.  And, to help make the transition easier, we’re offering a minimum sign-on bonus of $20,000.
 
Join an amazing community. Located on the Missouri River, South Sioux City is a growing town of nearly 15,000 residents. It offers convenient access to larger metropolitan areas in three states — Nebraska, South Dakota and Iowa. South Sioux has a rich Native American heritage, and is your gateway to two scenic byways that pay homage to America’s history: the Lewis and Clark Scenic Byway and the Outlaw Trail. For the outdoor enthusiast, it is home to numerous city and state parks as well as the 20-mile Al Bengtson Bike Trail. Take your career on a new adventure and call South Sioux City home!

Each location feels like a private practice but enjoys the support of a large organization. We empower our team members to think like owners and make the best decisions for their team, patients and practice.
Our values were built on a foundation of love for one another, regardless of race, color, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, religion or other attributes.

You’ll also immediately be an owner in our organization through our employee stock ownership plan and, if you choose, through any direct stock you purchase. You can take pride in joining an organization that prioritizes clinical quality in all decision-making, utilizing the expertise of an esteemed and expansive Clinical Committee. As a dentist, you will get the support, mentoring and guidance needed to provide excellent care for your patients and growth in your career.  And, to help make the transition easier, we’re offering a minimum sign-on bonus of $20,000.
 
Join an amazing community. Commonly known as “Indy,” Indiana’s state capital is home to the largest single-day sporting event and largest children’s museum in the world. There’s truly something for everyone in Indianapolis. Sports fan? Check out one of its two major league sports clubs, the Colts or the Pacers. Want to expand your mind?

Mortenson Dental Partners is one of the largest groups of employee-owned dental practices in the United States, with over 140 practices across nine states, over 1,800 team members and nearly one million patient visits each year. Unlike most dental support organizations, we are completely employee owned, with absolutely no private equity. Each location feels like a private practice but enjoys the support of a large organization. We empower our team members to think like owners and make the best decisions for their team, patients and practice.
Our values were built on a foundation of love for one another, regardless of race, color, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, religion or other attributes. We are committed to a workplace that fully represents the communities we serve as we live our four core values — caring for everyone, expressing gratitude, sharing abundantly and building relationships.

We are looking for passionate and dedicated general practice dentists who love creating long-lasting relationships with their patients. As a general dentist with Mortenson Dental Partners, you’ll have clinical autonomy along with a wealth of benefits.

As a new provider, you’ll enjoy a period of guaranteed income as you settle into your practice, followed by 30% of net collections. Our general dentists earn an average of $230,000, with some earning over $400,000 — there is really no limit to your earning potential!  You’ll also immediately be an owner in our organization through our employee stock ownership plan and, if you choose, through any direct stock you purchase. You can take pride in joining an organization that prioritizes clinical quality in all decision-making, utilizing the expertise of an esteemed and expansive Clinical Committee. As a dentist, you will get the support, mentoring and guidance needed to provide excellent care for your patients and growth in your career.  And, to help make the transition easier, we’re offering a minimum sign-on bonus of $20,000.
 
Join an amazing community. Located on the Missouri River, South Sioux City is a growing town of nearly 15,000 residents. It offers convenient access to larger metropolitan areas in three states — Nebraska, South Dakota and Iowa. South Sioux has a rich Native American heritage, and is your gateway to two scenic byways that pay homage to America’s history: the Lewis and Clark Scenic Byway and the Outlaw Trail.

You’ll also immediately be an owner in our organization through our employee stock ownership plan and, if you choose, through any direct stock you purchase. You can take pride in joining an organization that prioritizes clinical quality in all decision-making, utilizing the expertise of an esteemed and expansive Clinical Committee. As a dentist, you will get the support, mentoring and guidance needed to provide excellent care for your patients and growth in your career.  And, to help make the transition easier, we’re offering a minimum sign-on bonus of $20,000.
 
Join an amazing community. Located on the Missouri River, South Sioux City is a growing town of nearly 15,000 residents.

Mortenson Dental Partners is one of the largest groups of employee-owned dental practices in the United States, with over 140 practices across nine states, over 1,800 team members and nearly one million patient visits each year. Unlike most dental support organizations, we are completely employee owned, with absolutely no private equity. Each location feels like a private practice but enjoys the support of a large organization. We empower our team members to think like owners and make the best decisions for their team, patients and practice.
Our values were built on a foundation of love for one another, regardless of race, color, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, religion or other attributes. We are committed to a workplace that fully represents the communities we serve as we live our four core values — caring for everyone, expressing gratitude, sharing abundantly and building relationships.
 
About the Position
We are looking for passionate and dedicated general practice dentists who love creating long-lasting relationships with their patients. As a general dentist with Mortenson Dental Partners, you’ll have clinical autonomy along with a wealth of benefits. These include free internal clinical education classes on a variety of dental specialties, such as clear aligners, dental implants, endodontics and more! As a new provider, you’ll enjoy a period of guaranteed income as you settle into your practice, followed by 30% of net collections. Our general dentists earn an average of $230,000, with some earning over $400,000 — there is really no limit to your earning potential!  You’ll also immediately be an owner in our organization through our employee stock ownership plan and, if you choose, through any direct stock you purchase. You can take pride in joining an organization that prioritizes clinical quality in all decision-making, utilizing the expertise of an esteemed and expansive Clinical Committee. As a dentist, you will get the support, mentoring and guidance needed to provide excellent care for your patients and growth in your career.  And, to help make the transition easier, we’re offering a minimum sign-on bonus of $20,000.
 
Join an amazing community. Located on the Missouri River, South Sioux City is a growing town of nearly 15,000 residents. It offers convenient access to larger metropolitan areas in three states — Nebraska, South Dakota and Iowa. South Sioux has a rich Native American heritage, and is your gateway to two scenic byways that pay homage to America’s history: the Lewis and Clark Scenic Byway and the Outlaw Trail. For the outdoor enthusiast, it is home to numerous city and state parks as well as the 20-mile Al Bengtson Bike Trail. Take your career on a new adventure and call South Sioux City home!

Each location feels like a private practice but enjoys the support of a large organization. We empower our team members to think like owners and make the best decisions for their team, patients and practice.

You can take pride in joining an organization that prioritizes clinical quality in all decision-making, utilizing the expertise of an esteemed and expansive Clinical Committee. As a dentist, you will get the support, mentoring and guidance needed to provide excellent care for your patients and growth in your career.  And, to help make the transition easier, we’re offering a minimum sign-on bonus of $20,000.
 
Join an amazing community. Commonly known as “Indy,” Indiana’s state capital is home to the largest single-day sporting event and largest children’s museum in the world.

Each location feels like a private practice but enjoys the support of a large organization. We empower our team members to think like owners and make the best decisions for their team, patients and practice.
Our values were built on a foundation of love for one another, regardless of race, color, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, religion or other attributes.

Our general dentists earn an average of $230,000, with some earning over $400,000 — there is really no limit to your earning potential!  You’ll also immediately be an owner in our organization through our employee stock ownership plan and, if you choose, through any direct stock you purchase. You can take pride in joining an organization that prioritizes clinical quality in all decision-making, utilizing the expertise of an esteemed and expansive Clinical Committee. As a dentist, you will get the support, mentoring and guidance needed to provide excellent care for your patients and growth in your career.  And, to help make the transition easier, we’re offering a minimum sign-on bonus of $20,000.
 
Join an amazing community. Located on the Missouri River, South Sioux City is a growing town of nearly 15,000 residents.

Unlike most dental support organizations, we are completely employee owned, with absolutely no private equity. Each location feels like a private practice but enjoys the support of a large organization. We empower our team members to think like owners and make the best decisions for their team, patients and practice.
Our values were built on a foundation of love for one another, regardless of race, color, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, religion or other attributes.

Our general dentists earn an average of $230,000, with some earning over $400,000 — there is really no limit to your earning potential!  You’ll also immediately be an owner in our organization through our employee stock ownership plan and, if you choose, through any direct stock you purchase. You can take pride in joining an organization that prioritizes clinical quality in all decision-making, utilizing the expertise of an esteemed and expansive Clinical Committee. As a dentist, you will get the support, mentoring and guidance needed to provide excellent care for your patients and growth in your career.  And, to help make the transition easier, we’re offering a minimum sign-on bonus of $20,000.
 
Join an amazing community. Located on the Missouri River, South Sioux City is a growing town of nearly 15,000 residents. It offers convenient access to larger metropolitan areas in three states — Nebraska, South Dakota and Iowa. South Sioux has a rich Native American heritage, and is your gateway to two scenic byways that pay homage to America’s history: the Lewis and Clark Scenic Byway and the Outlaw Trail.

Each location feels like a private practice but enjoys the support of a large organization. We empower our team members to think like owners and make the best decisions for their team, patients and practice.
Our values were built on a foundation of love for one another, regardless of race, color, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, religion or other attributes.

Mortenson Dental Partners is one of the largest groups of employee-owned dental practices in the United States, with over 140 practices across nine states, over 1,800 team members and nearly one million patient visits each year. Unlike most dental support organizations, we are completely employee owned, with absolutely no private equity. Each location feels like a private practice but enjoys the support of a large organization. We empower our team members to think like owners and make the best decisions for their team, patients and practice.
Our values were built on a foundation of love for one another, regardless of race, color, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, religion or other attributes. We are committed to a workplace that fully represents the communities we serve as we live our four core values — caring for everyone, expressing gratitude, sharing abundantly and building relationships.
 
About the Position
We are looking for passionate and dedicated general practice dentists who love creating long-lasting relationships with their patients. As a general dentist with Mortenson Dental Partners, you’ll have clinical autonomy along with a wealth of benefits. These include free internal clinical education classes on a variety of dental specialties, such as clear aligners, dental implants, endodontics and more!

Our general dentists earn an average of $230,000, with some earning over $400,000 — there is really no limit to your earning potential!  You’ll also immediately be an owner in our organization through our employee stock ownership plan and, if you choose, through any direct stock you purchase. You can take pride in joining an organization that prioritizes clinical quality in all decision-making, utilizing the expertise of an esteemed and expansive Clinical Committee. As a dentist, you will get the support, mentoring and guidance needed to provide excellent care for your patients and growth in your career.  And, to help make the transition easier, we’re offering a minimum sign-on bonus of $20,000.
 
Join an amazing community. Located on the Missouri River, South Sioux City is a growing town of nearly 15,000 residents. It offers convenient access to larger metropolitan areas in three states — Nebraska, South Dakota and Iowa. South Sioux has a rich Native American heritage, and is your gateway to two scenic byways that pay homage to America’s history: the Lewis and Clark Scenic Byway and the Outlaw Trail. For the outdoor enthusiast, it is home to numerous city and state parks as well as the 20-mile Al Bengtson Bike Trail. Take your career on a new adventure and call South Sioux City home!

You can take pride in joining an organization that prioritizes clinical quality in all decision-making, utilizing the expertise of an esteemed and expansive Clinical Committee. As a dentist, you will get the support, mentoring and guidance needed to provide excellent care for your patients and growth in your career.  And, to help make the transition easier, we’re offering a minimum sign-on bonus of $20,000.

You can take pride in joining an organization that prioritizes clinical quality in all decision-making, utilizing the expertise of an esteemed and expansive Clinical Committee. As a dentist, you will get the support, mentoring and guidance needed to provide excellent care for your patients and growth in your career.  And, to help make the transition easier, we’re offering a minimum sign-on bonus of $20,000.
 
Join an amazing community. Commonly known as “Indy,” Indiana’s state capital is home to the largest single-day sporting event and largest children’s museum in the world.

Mortenson Dental Partners is one of the largest groups of employee-owned dental practices in the United States, with over 140 practices across nine states, over 1,800 team members and nearly one million patient visits each year. Unlike most dental support organizations, we are completely employee owned, with absolutely no private equity. Each location feels like a private practice but enjoys the support of a large organization. We empower our team members to think like owners and make the best decisions for their team, patients and practice.
Our values were built on a foundation of love for one another, regardless of race, color, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, religion or other attributes. We are committed to a workplace that fully represents the communities we serve as we live our four core values — caring for everyone, expressing gratitude, sharing abundantly and building relationships.
 
About the Position
We are looking for passionate and dedicated general practice dentists who love creating long-lasting relationships with their patients. As a general dentist with Mortenson Dental Partners, you’ll have clinical autonomy along with a wealth of benefits. These include free internal clinical education classes on a variety of dental specialties, such as clear aligners, dental implants, endodontics and more! As a new provider, you’ll enjoy a period of guaranteed income as you settle into your practice, followed by 30% of net collections. Our general dentists earn an average of $230,000, with some earning over $400,000 — there is really no limit to your earning potential!  You’ll also immediately be an owner in our organization through our employee stock ownership plan and, if you choose, through any direct stock you purchase.

You can take pride in joining an organization that prioritizes clinical quality in all decision-making, utilizing the expertise of an esteemed and expansive Clinical Committee. As a dentist, you will get the support, mentoring and guidance needed to provide excellent care for your patients and growth in your career.  And, to help make the transition easier, we’re offering a minimum sign-on bonus of $20,000.

Mortenson Dental Partners is one of the largest groups of employee-owned dental practices in the United States, with over 140 practices across nine states, over 1,800 team members and nearly one million patient visits each year. Unlike most dental support organizations, we are completely employee owned, with absolutely no private equity. Each location feels like a private practice but enjoys the support of a large organization. We empower our team members to think like owners and make the best decisions for their team, patients and practice.
Our values were built on a foundation of love for one another, regardless of race, color, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, religion or other attributes. We are committed to a workplace that fully represents the communities we serve as we live our four core values — caring for everyone, expressing gratitude, sharing abundantly and building relationships.
 
About the Position
We are looking for passionate and dedicated general practice dentists who love creating long-lasting relationships with their patients. As a general dentist with Mortenson Dental Partners, you’ll have clinical autonomy along with a wealth of benefits. These include free internal clinical education classes on a variety of dental specialties, such as clear aligners, dental implants, endodontics and more!

Our general dentists earn an average of $230,000, with some earning over $400,000 — there is really no limit to your earning potential!  You’ll also immediately be an owner in our organization through our employee stock ownership plan and, if you choose, through any direct stock you purchase. You can take pride in joining an organization that prioritizes clinical quality in all decision-making, utilizing the expertise of an esteemed and expansive Clinical Committee. As a dentist, you will get the support, mentoring and guidance needed to provide excellent care for your patients and growth in your career.  And, to help make the transition easier, we’re offering a minimum sign-on bonus of $20,000.
 
Join an amazing community. Located on the Missouri River, South Sioux City is a growing town of nearly 15,000 residents. It offers convenient access to larger metropolitan areas in three states — Nebraska, South Dakota and Iowa. South Sioux has a rich Native American heritage, and is your gateway to two scenic byways that pay homage to America’s history: the Lewis and Clark Scenic Byway and the Outlaw Trail. For the outdoor enthusiast, it is home to numerous city and state parks as well as the 20-mile Al Bengtson Bike Trail. Take your career on a new adventure and call South Sioux City home!

Each location feels like a private practice but enjoys the support of a large organization. We empower our team members to think like owners and make the best decisions for their team, patients and practice.
Our values were built on a foundation of love for one another, regardless of race, color, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, religion or other attributes.

You’ll also immediately be an owner in our organization through our employee stock ownership plan and, if you choose, through any direct stock you purchase. You can take pride in joining an organization that prioritizes clinical quality in all decision-making, utilizing the expertise of an esteemed and expansive Clinical Committee. As a dentist, you will get the support, mentoring and guidance needed to provide excellent care for your patients and growth in your career.  And, to help make the transition easier, we’re offering a minimum sign-on bonus of $20,000.
 
Join an amazing community. Commonly known as “Indy,” Indiana’s state capital is home to the largest single-day sporting event and largest children’s museum in the world. There’s truly something for everyone in Indianapolis. Sports fan? Check out one of its two major league sports clubs, the Colts or the Pacers. Want to expand your mind?

You can take pride in joining an organization that prioritizes clinical quality in all decision-making, utilizing the expertise of an esteemed and expansive Clinical Committee. As a dentist, you will get the support, mentoring and guidance needed to provide excellent care for your patients and growth in your career.  And, to help make the transition easier, we’re offering a minimum sign-on bonus of $20,000.

Mortenson Dental Partners is one of the largest groups of employee-owned dental practices in the United States, with over 140 practices across nine states, over 1,800 team members and nearly one million patient visits each year. Unlike most dental support organizations, we are completely employee owned, with absolutely no private equity. Each location feels like a private practice but enjoys the support of a large organization. We empower our team members to think like owners and make the best decisions for their team, patients and practice.
Our values were built on a foundation of love for one another, regardless of race, color, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, religion or other attributes. We are committed to a workplace that fully represents the communities we serve as we live our four core values — caring for everyone, expressing gratitude, sharing abundantly and building relationships.

We are looking for passionate and dedicated general practice dentists who love creating long-lasting relationships with their patients. As a general dentist with Mortenson Dental Partners, you’ll have clinical autonomy along with a wealth of benefits.

Our general dentists earn an average of $230,000, with some earning over $400,000 — there is really no limit to your earning potential!  You’ll also immediately be an owner in our organization through our employee stock ownership plan and, if you choose, through any direct stock you purchase. You can take pride in joining an organization that prioritizes clinical quality in all decision-making, utilizing the expertise of an esteemed and expansive Clinical Committee. As a dentist, you will get the support, mentoring and guidance needed to provide excellent care for your patients and growth in your career.  And, to help make the transition easier, we’re offering a minimum sign-on bonus of $20,000.
 
Join an amazing community. Located on the Missouri River, South Sioux City is a growing town of nearly 15,000 residents. It offers convenient access to larger metropolitan areas in three states — Nebraska, South Dakota and Iowa. South Sioux has a rich Native American heritage, and is your gateway to two scenic byways that pay homage to America’s history: the Lewis and Clark Scenic Byway and the Outlaw Trail.

Mortenson Dental Partners is one of the largest groups of employee-owned dental practices in the United States, with over 140 practices across nine states, over 1,800 team members and nearly one million patient visits each year. Unlike most dental support organizations, we are completely employee owned, with absolutely no private equity. Each location feels like a private practice but enjoys the support of a large organization. We empower our team members to think like owners and make the best decisions for their team, patients and practice.
Our values were built on a foundation of love for one another, regardless of race, color, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, religion or other attributes. We are committed to a workplace that fully represents the communities we serve as we live our four core values — caring for everyone, expressing gratitude, sharing abundantly and building relationships.
 
About the Position
We are looking for passionate and dedicated general practice dentists who love creating long-lasting relationships with their patients. As a general dentist with Mortenson Dental Partners, you’ll have clinical autonomy along with a wealth of benefits. These include free internal clinical education classes on a variety of dental specialties, such as clear aligners, dental implants, endodontics and more! As a new provider, you’ll enjoy a period of guaranteed income as you settle into your practice, followed by 30% of net collections. Our general dentists earn an average of $230,000, with some earning over $400,000 — there is really no limit to your earning potential!  You’ll also immediately be an owner in our organization through our employee stock ownership plan and, if you choose, through any direct stock you purchase. You can take pride in joining an organization that prioritizes clinical quality in all decision-making, utilizing the expertise of an esteemed and expansive Clinical Committee. As a dentist, you will get the support, mentoring and guidance needed to provide excellent care for your patients and growth in your career.  And, to help make the transition easier, we’re offering a minimum sign-on bonus of $20,000.

18185948,"South Sioux City, Nebraska, United States",Nebraska,2023-09-26,Mortenson Dental Partners,Permanent/Full-Time,,"About the Company
Mortenson Dental Partners is one of the largest groups of employee-owned dental practices in the United States, with over 140 practices across nine states, over 1,800 team members and nearly one million patient visits each year. Unlike most dental support organizations, we are completely employee owned, with absolutely no private equity. Each location feels like a private practice but enjoys the support of a large organization. We empower our team members to think like owners and make the best decisions for their team, patients and practice.
Our values were built on a foundation of love for one another, regardless of race, color, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, religion or other attributes. We are committed to a workplace that fully represents the communities we serve as we live our four core values — caring for everyone, expressing gratitude, sharing abundantly and building relationships.
 
About the Position
We are looking for passionate and dedicated general practice dentists who love creating long-lasting relationships with their patients. As a general dentist with Mortenson Dental Partners, you’ll have clinical autonomy along with a wealth of benefits. These include free internal clinical education classes on a variety of dental specialties, such as clear aligners, dental implants, endodontics and more! As a new provider, you’ll enjoy a period of guaranteed income as you settle into your practice, followed by 30% of net collections. Our general dentists earn an average of $230,000, with some earning over $400,000 — there is really no limit to your earning potential!  You’ll also immediately be an owner in our organization through our employee stock ownership plan and, if you choose, through any direct stock you purchase. You can take pride in joining an organization that prioritizes clinical quality in all decision-making, utilizing the expertise of an esteemed and expansive Clinical Committee. As a dentist, you will get the support, mentoring and guidance needed to provide excellent care for your patients and growth in your career.  And, to help make the transition easier, we’re offering a minimum sign-on bonus of $20,000.
 
Join an amazing community. Located on the Missouri River, South Sioux City is a growing town of nearly 15,000 residents. It offers convenient access to larger metropolitan areas in three states — Nebraska, South Dakota and Iowa. South Sioux has a rich Native American heritage, and is your gateway to two scenic byways that pay homage to America’s history: the Lewis and Clark Scenic Byway and the Outlaw Trail. For the outdoor enthusiast, it is home to numerous city and state parks as well as the 20-mile Al Bengtson Bike Trail. Take your career on a new adventure and call South Sioux City home!

You can take pride in joining an organization that prioritizes clinical quality in all decision-making, utilizing the expertise of an esteemed and expansive Clinical Committee. As a dentist, you will get the support, mentoring and guidance needed to provide excellent care for your patients and growth in your career.  And, to help make the transition easier, we’re offering a minimum sign-on bonus of $20,000.

Mortenson Dental Partners is one of the largest groups of employee-owned dental practices in the United States, with over 140 practices across nine states, over 1,800 team members and nearly one million patient visits each year. Unlike most dental support organizations, we are completely employee owned, with absolutely no private equity. Each location feels like a private practice but enjoys the support of a large organization. We empower our team members to think like owners and make the best decisions for their team, patients and practice.
Our values were built on a foundation of love for one another, regardless of race, color, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, religion or other attributes. We are committed to a workplace that fully represents the communities we serve as we live our four core values — caring for everyone, expressing gratitude, sharing abundantly and building relationships.

Our general dentists earn an average of $230,000, with some earning over $400,000 — there is really no limit to your earning potential!  You’ll also immediately be an owner in our organization through our employee stock ownership plan and, if you choose, through any direct stock you purchase. You can take pride in joining an organization that prioritizes clinical quality in all decision-making, utilizing the expertise of an esteemed and expansive Clinical Committee. As a dentist, you will get the support, mentoring and guidance needed to provide excellent care for your patients and growth in your career.  And, to help make the transition easier, we’re offering a minimum sign-on bonus of $20,000.
 
Join an amazing community. Located on the Missouri River, South Sioux City is a growing town of nearly 15,000 residents. It offers convenient access to larger metropolitan areas in three states — Nebraska, South Dakota and Iowa. South Sioux has a rich Native American heritage, and is your gateway to two scenic byways that pay homage to America’s history: the Lewis and Clark Scenic Byway and the Outlaw Trail.

Unlike most dental support organizations, we are completely employee owned, with absolutely no private equity. Each location feels like a private practice but enjoys the support of a large organization. We empower our team members to think like owners and make the best decisions for their team, patients and practice.
Our values were built on a foundation of love for one another, regardless of race, color, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, religion or other attributes. We are committed to a workplace that fully represents the communities we serve as we live our four core values — caring for everyone, expressing gratitude, sharing abundantly and building relationships.
 
About the Position
We are looking for passionate and dedicated general practice dentists who love creating long-lasting relationships with their patients. As a general dentist with Mortenson Dental Partners, you’ll have clinical autonomy along with a wealth of benefits. These include free internal clinical education classes on a variety of dental specialties, such as clear aligners, dental implants, endodontics and more!

Mortenson Dental Partners is one of the largest groups of employee-owned dental practices in the United States, with over 140 practices across nine states, over 1,800 team members and nearly one million patient visits each year. Unlike most dental support organizations, we are completely employee owned, with absolutely no private equity. Each location feels like a private practice but enjoys the support of a large organization. We empower our team members to think like owners and make the best decisions for their team, patients and practice.
Our values were built on a foundation of love for one another, regardless of race, color, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, religion or other attributes. We are committed to a workplace that fully represents the communities we serve as we live our four core values — caring for everyone, expressing gratitude, sharing abundantly and building relationships.
 
About the Position
We are looking for passionate and dedicated general practice dentists who love creating long-lasting relationships with their patients. As a general dentist with Mortenson Dental Partners, you’ll have clinical autonomy along with a wealth of benefits. These include free internal clinical education classes on a variety of dental specialties, such as clear aligners, dental implants, endodontics and more! As a new provider, you’ll enjoy a period of guaranteed income as you settle into your practice, followed by 30% of net collections. Our general dentists earn an average of $230,000, with some earning over $400,000 — there is really no limit to your earning potential!  You’ll also immediately be an owner in our organization through our employee stock ownership plan and, if you choose, through any direct stock you purchase. You can take pride in joining an organization that prioritizes clinical quality in all decision-making, utilizing the expertise of an esteemed and expansive Clinical Committee. As a dentist, you will get the support, mentoring and guidance needed to provide excellent care for your patients and growth in your career.  And, to help make the transition easier, we’re offering a minimum sign-on bonus of $20,000.
 
Join an amazing community. Located on the Missouri River, South Sioux City is a growing town of nearly 15,000 residents. It offers convenient access to larger metropolitan areas in three states — Nebraska, South Dakota and Iowa. South Sioux has a rich Native American heritage, and is your gateway to two scenic byways that pay homage to America’s history: the Lewis and Clark Scenic Byway and the Outlaw Trail. For the outdoor enthusiast, it is home to numerous city and state parks as well as the 20-mile Al Bengtson Bike Trail. Take your career on a new adventure and call South Sioux City home!

Each location feels like a private practice but enjoys the support of a large organization. We empower our team members to think like owners and make the best decisions for their team, patients and practice.
Our values were built on a foundation of love for one another, regardless of race, color, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, religion or other attributes.

You’ll also immediately be an owner in our organization through our employee stock ownership plan and, if you choose, through any direct stock you purchase. You can take pride in joining an organization that prioritizes clinical quality in all decision-making, utilizing the expertise of an esteemed and expansive Clinical Committee. As a dentist, you will get the support, mentoring and guidance needed to provide excellent care for your patients and growth in your career.  And, to help make the transition easier, we’re offering a minimum sign-on bonus of $20,000.
 
Join an amazing community. Commonly known as “Indy,” Indiana’s state capital is home to the largest single-day sporting event and largest children’s museum in the world. There’s truly something for everyone in Indianapolis. Sports fan? Check out one of its two major league sports clubs, the Colts or the Pacers. Want to expand your mind?

Mortenson Dental Partners is one of the largest groups of employee-owned dental practices in the United States, with over 140 practices across nine states, over 1,800 team members and nearly one million patient visits each year. Unlike most dental support organizations, we are completely employee owned, with absolutely no private equity. Each location feels like a private practice but enjoys the support of a large organization. We empower our team members to think like owners and make the best decisions for their team, patients and practice.
Our values were built on a foundation of love for one another, regardless of race, color, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, religion or other attributes. We are committed to a workplace that fully represents the communities we serve as we live our four core values — caring for everyone, expressing gratitude, sharing abundantly and building relationships.

We are looking for passionate and dedicated general practice dentists who love creating long-lasting relationships with their patients. As a general dentist with Mortenson Dental Partners, you’ll have clinical autonomy along with a wealth of benefits.

As a new provider, you’ll enjoy a period of guaranteed income as you settle into your practice, followed by 30% of net collections. Our general dentists earn an average of $230,000, with some earning over $400,000 — there is really no limit to your earning potential!  You’ll also immediately be an owner in our organization through our employee stock ownership plan and, if you choose, through any direct stock you purchase. You can take pride in joining an organization that prioritizes clinical quality in all decision-making, utilizing the expertise of an esteemed and expansive Clinical Committee. As a dentist, you will get the support, mentoring and guidance needed to provide excellent care for your patients and growth in your career.  And, to help make the transition easier, we’re offering a minimum sign-on bonus of $20,000.
 
Join an amazing community. Located on the Missouri River, South Sioux City is a growing town of nearly 15,000 residents. It offers convenient access to larger metropolitan areas in three states — Nebraska, South Dakota and Iowa. South Sioux has a rich Native American heritage, and is your gateway to two scenic byways that pay homage to America’s history: the Lewis and Clark Scenic Byway and the Outlaw Trail.

You’ll also immediately be an owner in our organization through our employee stock ownership plan and, if you choose, through any direct stock you purchase. You can take pride in joining an organization that prioritizes clinical quality in all decision-making, utilizing the expertise of an esteemed and expansive Clinical Committee. As a dentist, you will get the support, mentoring and guidance needed to provide excellent care for your patients and growth in your career.  And, to help make the transition easier, we’re offering a minimum sign-on bonus of $20,000.
 
Join an amazing community. Located on the Missouri River, South Sioux City is a growing town of nearly 15,000 residents.

Mortenson Dental Partners is one of the largest groups of employee-owned dental practices in the United States, with over 140 practices across nine states, over 1,800 team members and nearly one million patient visits each year. Unlike most dental support organizations, we are completely employee owned, with absolutely no private equity. Each location feels like a private practice but enjoys the support of a large organization. We empower our team members to think like owners and make the best decisions for their team, patients and practice.
Our values were built on a foundation of love for one another, regardless of race, color, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, religion or other attributes. We are committed to a workplace that fully represents the communities we serve as we live our four core values — caring for everyone, expressing gratitude, sharing abundantly and building relationships.
 
About the Position
We are looking for passionate and dedicated general practice dentists who love creating long-lasting relationships with their patients. As a general dentist with Mortenson Dental Partners, you’ll have clinical autonomy along with a wealth of benefits. These include free internal clinical education classes on a variety of dental specialties, such as clear aligners, dental implants, endodontics and more! As a new provider, you’ll enjoy a period of guaranteed income as you settle into your practice, followed by 30% of net collections. Our general dentists earn an average of $230,000, with some earning over $400,000 — there is really no limit to your earning potential!  You’ll also immediately be an owner in our organization through our employee stock ownership plan and, if you choose, through any direct stock you purchase. You can take pride in joining an organization that prioritizes clinical quality in all decision-making, utilizing the expertise of an esteemed and expansive Clinical Committee. As a dentist, you will get the support, mentoring and guidance needed to provide excellent care for your patients and growth in your career.  And, to help make the transition easier, we’re offering a minimum sign-on bonus of $20,000.
 
Join an amazing community. Located on the Missouri River, South Sioux City is a growing town of nearly 15,000 residents. It offers convenient access to larger metropolitan areas in three states — Nebraska, South Dakota and Iowa. South Sioux has a rich Native American heritage, and is your gateway to two scenic byways that pay homage to America’s history: the Lewis and Clark Scenic Byway and the Outlaw Trail. For the outdoor enthusiast, it is home to numerous city and state parks as well as the 20-mile Al Bengtson Bike Trail. Take your career on a new adventure and call South Sioux City home!

Each location feels like a private practice but enjoys the support of a large organization. We empower our team members to think like owners and make the best decisions for their team, patients and practice.

You can take pride in joining an organization that prioritizes clinical quality in all decision-making, utilizing the expertise of an esteemed and expansive Clinical Committee. As a dentist, you will get the support, mentoring and guidance needed to provide excellent care for your patients and growth in your career.  And, to help make the transition easier, we’re offering a minimum sign-on bonus of $20,000.
 
Join an amazing community. Commonly known as “Indy,” Indiana’s state capital is home to the largest single-day sporting event and largest children’s museum in the world.

Each location feels like a private practice but enjoys the support of a large organization. We empower our team members to think like owners and make the best decisions for their team, patients and practice.
Our values were built on a foundation of love for one another, regardless of race, color, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, religion or other attributes.

Our general dentists earn an average of $230,000, with some earning over $400,000 — there is really no limit to your earning potential!  You’ll also immediately be an owner in our organization through our employee stock ownership plan and, if you choose, through any direct stock you purchase. You can take pride in joining an organization that prioritizes clinical quality in all decision-making, utilizing the expertise of an esteemed and expansive Clinical Committee. As a dentist, you will get the support, mentoring and guidance needed to provide excellent care for your patients and growth in your career.  And, to help make the transition easier, we’re offering a minimum sign-on bonus of $20,000.
 
Join an amazing community. Located on the Missouri River, South Sioux City is a growing town of nearly 15,000 residents.

Unlike most dental support organizations, we are completely employee owned, with absolutely no private equity. Each location feels like a private practice but enjoys the support of a large organization. We empower our team members to think like owners and make the best decisions for their team, patients and practice.
Our values were built on a foundation of love for one another, regardless of race, color, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, religion or other attributes.

Our general dentists earn an average of $230,000, with some earning over $400,000 — there is really no limit to your earning potential!  You’ll also immediately be an owner in our organization through our employee stock ownership plan and, if you choose, through any direct stock you purchase. You can take pride in joining an organization that prioritizes clinical quality in all decision-making, utilizing the expertise of an esteemed and expansive Clinical Committee. As a dentist, you will get the support, mentoring and guidance needed to provide excellent care for your patients and growth in your career.  And, to help make the transition easier, we’re offering a minimum sign-on bonus of $20,000.
 
Join an amazing community. Located on the Missouri River, South Sioux City is a growing town of nearly 15,000 residents. It offers convenient access to larger metropolitan areas in three states — Nebraska, South Dakota and Iowa. South Sioux has a rich Native American heritage, and is your gateway to two scenic byways that pay homage to America’s history: the Lewis and Clark Scenic Byway and the Outlaw Trail.

Each location feels like a private practice but enjoys the support of a large organization. We empower our team members to think like owners and make the best decisions for their team, patients and practice.
Our values were built on a foundation of love for one another, regardless of race, color, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, religion or other attributes.

Mortenson Dental Partners is one of the largest groups of employee-owned dental practices in the United States, with over 140 practices across nine states, over 1,800 team members and nearly one million patient visits each year. Unlike most dental support organizations, we are completely employee owned, with absolutely no private equity. Each location feels like a private practice but enjoys the support of a large organization. We empower our team members to think like owners and make the best decisions for their team, patients and practice.
Our values were built on a foundation of love for one another, regardless of race, color, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, religion or other attributes. We are committed to a workplace that fully represents the communities we serve as we live our four core values — caring for everyone, expressing gratitude, sharing abundantly and building relationships.
 
About the Position
We are looking for passionate and dedicated general practice dentists who love creating long-lasting relationships with their patients. As a general dentist with Mortenson Dental Partners, you’ll have clinical autonomy along with a wealth of benefits. These include free internal clinical education classes on a variety of dental specialties, such as clear aligners, dental implants, endodontics and more!

Our general dentists earn an average of $230,000, with some earning over $400,000 — there is really no limit to your earning potential!  You’ll also immediately be an owner in our organization through our employee stock ownership plan and, if you choose, through any direct stock you purchase. You can take pride in joining an organization that prioritizes clinical quality in all decision-making, utilizing the expertise of an esteemed and expansive Clinical Committee. As a dentist, you will get the support, mentoring and guidance needed to provide excellent care for your patients and growth in your career.  And, to help make the transition easier, we’re offering a minimum sign-on bonus of $20,000.
 
Join an amazing community. Located on the Missouri River, South Sioux City is a growing town of nearly 15,000 residents. It offers convenient access to larger metropolitan areas in three states — Nebraska, South Dakota and Iowa. South Sioux has a rich Native American heritage, and is your gateway to two scenic byways that pay homage to America’s history: the Lewis and Clark Scenic Byway and the Outlaw Trail. For the outdoor enthusiast, it is home to numerous city and state parks as well as the 20-mile Al Bengtson Bike Trail. Take your career on a new adventure and call South Sioux City home!

You’ll also immediately be an owner in our organization through our employee stock ownership plan and, if you choose, through any direct stock you purchase. You can take pride in joining an organization that prioritizes clinical quality in all decision-making, utilizing the expertise of an esteemed and expansive Clinical Committee. As a dentist, you will get the support, mentoring and guidance needed to provide excellent care for your patients and growth in your career.  And, to help make the transition easier, we’re offering a minimum sign-on bonus of $20,000.

Mortenson Dental Partners is one of the largest groups of employee-owned dental practices in the United States, with over 140 practices across nine states, over 1,800 team members and nearly one million patient visits each year. Unlike most dental support organizations, we are completely employee owned, with absolutely no private equity. Each location feels like a private practice but enjoys the support of a large organization. We empower our team members to think like owners and make the best decisions for their team, patients and practice.
Our values were built on a foundation of love for one another, regardless of race, color, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, religion or other attributes. We are committed to a workplace that fully represents the communities we serve as we live our four core values — caring for everyone, expressing gratitude, sharing abundantly and building relationships.

As a general dentist with Mortenson Dental Partners, you’ll have clinical autonomy along with a wealth of benefits. These include free internal clinical education classes on a variety of dental specialties, such as clear aligners, dental implants, endodontics and more! As a new provider, you’ll enjoy a period of guaranteed income as you settle into your practice, followed by 30% of net collections. Our general dentists earn an average of $230,000, with some earning over $400,000 — there is really no limit to your earning potential!  You’ll also immediately be an owner in our organization through our employee stock ownership plan and, if you choose, through any direct stock you purchase. You can take pride in joining an organization that prioritizes clinical quality in all decision-making, utilizing the expertise of an esteemed and expansive Clinical Committee. As a dentist, you will get the support, mentoring and guidance needed to provide excellent care for your patients and growth in your career.  And, to help make the transition easier, we’re offering a minimum sign-on bonus of $20,000.

Mortenson Dental Partners is one of the largest groups of employee-owned dental practices in the United States, with over 140 practices across nine states, over 1,800 team members and nearly one million patient visits each year. Unlike most dental support organizations, we are completely employee owned, with absolutely no private equity. Each location feels like a private practice but enjoys the support of a large organization. We empower our team members to think like owners and make the best decisions for their team, patients and practice.
Our values were built on a foundation of love for one another, regardless of race, color, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, religion or other attributes. We are committed to a workplace that fully represents the communities we serve as we live our four core values — caring for everyone, expressing gratitude, sharing abundantly and building relationships.
 
About the Position
We are looking for passionate and dedicated general practice dentists who love creating long-lasting relationships with their patients. As a general dentist with Mortenson Dental Partners, you’ll have clinical autonomy along with a wealth of benefits. These include free internal clinical education classes on a variety of dental specialties, such as clear aligners, dental implants, endodontics and more! As a new provider, you’ll enjoy a period of guaranteed income as you settle into your practice, followed by 30% of net collections. Our general dentists earn an average of $230,000, with some earning over $400,000 — there is really no limit to your earning potential!  You’ll also immediately be an owner in our organization through our employee stock ownership plan and, if you choose, through any direct stock you purchase. You can take pride in joining an organization that prioritizes clinical quality in all decision-making, utilizing the expertise of an esteemed and expansive Clinical Committee. As a dentist, you will get the support, mentoring and guidance needed to provide excellent care for your patients and growth in your career.  And, to help make the transition easier, we’re offering a minimum sign-on bonus of $20,000.

Mortenson Dental Partners is one of the largest groups of employee-owned dental practices in the United States, with over 140 practices across nine states, over 1,800 team members and nearly one million patient visits each year. Unlike most dental support organizations, we are completely employee owned, with absolutely no private equity. Each location feels like a private practice but enjoys the support of a large organization. We empower our team members to think like owners and make the best decisions for their team, patients and practice.
Our values were built on a foundation of love for one another, regardless of race, color, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, religion or other attributes.

You’ll also immediately be an owner in our organization through our employee stock ownership plan and, if you choose, through any direct stock you purchase. You can take pride in joining an organization that prioritizes clinical quality in all decision-making, utilizing the expertise of an esteemed and expansive Clinical Committee. As a dentist, you will get the support, mentoring and guidance needed to provide excellent care for your patients and growth in your career.  And, to help make the transition easier, we’re offering a minimum sign-on bonus of $20,000.

Mortenson Dental Partners is one of the largest groups of employee-owned dental practices in the United States, with over 140 practices across nine states, over 1,800 team members and nearly one million patient visits each year. Unlike most dental support organizations, we are completely employee owned, with absolutely no private equity. Each location feels like a private practice but enjoys the support of a large organization. We empower our team members to think like owners and make the best decisions for their team, patients and practice.
Our values were built on a foundation of love for one another, regardless of race, color, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, religion or other attributes. We are committed to a workplace that fully represents the communities we serve as we live our four core values — caring for everyone, expressing gratitude, sharing abundantly and building relationships.

We are looking for passionate and dedicated general practice dentists who love creating long-lasting relationships with their patients. As a general dentist with Mortenson Dental Partners, you’ll have clinical autonomy along with a wealth of benefits. These include free internal clinical education classes on a variety of dental specialties, such as clear aligners, dental implants, endodontics and more! As a new provider, you’ll enjoy a period of guaranteed income as you settle into your practice, followed by 30% of net collections. Our general dentists earn an average of $230,000, with some earning over $400,000 — there is really no limit to your earning potential!  You’ll also immediately be an owner in our organization through our employee stock ownership plan and, if you choose, through any direct stock you purchase. You can take pride in joining an organization that prioritizes clinical quality in all decision-making, utilizing the expertise of an esteemed and expansive Clinical Committee. As a dentist, you will get the support, mentoring and guidance needed to provide excellent care for your patients and growth in your career.  And, to help make the transition easier, we’re offering a minimum sign-on bonus of $20,000.

It offers convenient access to larger metropolitan areas in three states — Nebraska, South Dakota and Iowa.

Mortenson Dental Partners is one of the largest groups of employee-owned dental practices in the United States, with over 140 practices across nine states, over 1,800 team members and nearly one million patient visits each year. Unlike most dental support organizations, we are completely employee owned, with absolutely no private equity. Each location feels like a private practice but enjoys the support of a large organization. We empower our team members to think like owners and make the best decisions for their team, patients and practice.
Our values were built on a foundation of love for one another, regardless of race, color, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, religion or other attributes. We are committed to a workplace that fully represents the communities we serve as we live our four core values — caring for everyone, expressing gratitude, sharing abundantly and building relationships.
 
About the Position
We are looking for passionate and dedicated general practice dentists who love creating long-lasting relationships with their patients. As a general dentist with Mortenson Dental Partners, you’ll have clinical autonomy along with a wealth of benefits. These include free internal clinical education classes on a variety of dental specialties, such as clear aligners, dental implants, endodontics and more!

Mortenson Dental Partners is one of the largest groups of employee-owned dental practices in the United States, with over 140 practices across nine states, over 1,800 team members and nearly one million patient visits each year. Unlike most dental support organizations, we are completely employee owned, with absolutely no private equity. Each location feels like a private practice but enjoys the support of a large organization. We empower our team members to think like owners and make the best decisions for their team, patients and practice.
Our values were built on a foundation of love for one another, regardless of race, color, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, religion or other attributes.

You’ll also immediately be an owner in our organization through our employee stock ownership plan and, if you choose, through any direct stock you purchase. You can take pride in joining an organization that prioritizes clinical quality in all decision-making, utilizing the expertise of an esteemed and expansive Clinical Committee. As a dentist, you will get the support, mentoring and guidance needed to provide excellent care for your patients and growth in your career.  And, to help make the transition easier, we’re offering a minimum sign-on bonus of $20,000.

Mortenson Dental Partners is one of the largest groups of employee-owned dental practices in the United States, with over 140 practices across nine states, over 1,800 team members and nearly one million patient visits each year. Unlike most dental support organizations, we are completely employee owned, with absolutely no private equity. Each location feels like a private practice but enjoys the support of a large organization. We empower our team members to think like owners and make the best decisions for their team, patients and practice.
Our values were built on a foundation of love for one another, regardless of race, color, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, religion or other attributes. We are committed to a workplace that fully represents the communities we serve as we live our four core values — caring for everyone, expressing gratitude, sharing abundantly and building relationships.

We are looking for passionate and dedicated general practice dentists who love creating long-lasting relationships with their patients. As a general dentist with Mortenson Dental Partners, you’ll have clinical autonomy along with a wealth of benefits. These include free internal clinical education classes on a variety of dental specialties, such as clear aligners, dental implants, endodontics and more! As a new provider, you’ll enjoy a period of guaranteed income as you settle into your practice, followed by 30% of net collections. Our general dentists earn an average of $230,000, with some earning over $400,000 — there is really no limit to your earning potential!  You’ll also immediately be an owner in our organization through our employee stock ownership plan and, if you choose, through any direct stock you purchase. You can take pride in joining an organization that prioritizes clinical quality in all decision-making, utilizing the expertise of an esteemed and expansive Clinical Committee. As a dentist, you will get the support, mentoring and guidance needed to provide excellent care for your patients and growth in your career.  And, to help make the transition easier, we’re offering a minimum sign-on bonus of $20,000.

Mortenson Dental Partners is one of the largest groups of employee-owned dental practices in the United States, with over 140 practices across nine states, over 1,800 team members and nearly one million patient visits each year. Unlike most dental support organizations, we are completely employee owned, with absolutely no private equity. Each location feels like a private practice but enjoys the support of a large organization. We empower our team members to think like owners and make the best decisions for their team, patients and practice.
Our values were built on a foundation of love for one another, regardless of race, color, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, religion or other attributes.

Our general dentists earn an average of $230,000, with some earning over $400,000 — there is really no limit to your earning potential!  You’ll also immediately be an owner in our organization through our employee stock ownership plan and, if you choose, through any direct stock you purchase. You can take pride in joining an organization that prioritizes clinical quality in all decision-making, utilizing the expertise of an esteemed and expansive Clinical Committee. As a dentist, you will get the support, mentoring and guidance needed to provide excellent care for your patients and growth in your career.  And, to help make the transition easier, we’re offering a minimum sign-on bonus of $20,000.

Each location feels like a private practice but enjoys the support of a large organization.

You’ll also immediately be an owner in our organization through our employee stock ownership plan and, if you choose, through any direct stock you purchase. You can take pride in joining an organization that prioritizes clinical quality in all decision-making, utilizing the expertise of an esteemed and expansive Clinical Committee. As a dentist, you will get the support, mentoring and guidance needed to provide excellent care for your patients and growth in your career.

Each location feels like a private practice but enjoys the support of a large organization. We empower our team members to think like owners and make the best decisions for their team, patients and practice.
Our values were built on a foundation of love for one another, regardless of race, color, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, religion or other attributes.

You’ll also immediately be an owner in our organization through our employee stock ownership plan and, if you choose, through any direct stock you purchase. You can take pride in joining an organization that prioritizes clinical quality in all decision-making, utilizing the expertise of an esteemed and expansive Clinical Committee. As a dentist, you will get the support, mentoring and guidance needed to provide excellent care for your patients and growth in your career.  And, to help make the transition easier, we’re offering a minimum sign-on bonus of $20,000.

Each location feels like a private practice but enjoys the support of a large organization. We empower our team members to think like owners and make the best decisions for their team, patients and practice.
Our values were built on a foundation of love for one another, regardless of race, color, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, religion or other attributes.

You can take pride in joining an organization that prioritizes clinical quality in all decision-making, utilizing the expertise of an esteemed and expansive Clinical Committee. As a dentist, you will get the support, mentoring and guidance needed to provide excellent care for your patients and growth in your career.  And, to help make the transition easier, we’re offering a minimum sign-on bonus of $20,000.

We empower our team members to think like owners and make the best decisions for their team, patients and practice.
Our values were built on a foundation of love for one another, regardless of race, color, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, religion or other attributes. We are committed to a workplace that fully represents the communities we serve as we live our four core values — caring for everyone, expressing gratitude, sharing abundantly and building relationships.

As a new provider, you’ll enjoy a period of guaranteed income as you settle into your practice, followed by 30% of net collections. Our general dentists earn an average of $230,000, with some earning over $400,000 — there is really no limit to your earning potential!  You’ll also immediately be an owner in our organization through our employee stock ownership plan and, if you choose, through any direct stock you purchase. You can take pride in joining an organization that prioritizes clinical quality in all decision-making, utilizing the expertise of an esteemed and expansive Clinical Committee. As a dentist, you will get the support, mentoring and guidance needed to provide excellent care for your patients and growth in your career.

Unlike most dental support organizations, we are completely employee owned, with absolutely no private equity. Each location feels like a private practice but enjoys the support of a large organization. We empower our team members to think like owners and make the best decisions for their team, patients and practice.
Our values were built on a foundation of love for one another, regardless of race, color, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, religion or other attributes.

You’ll also immediately be an owner in our organization through our employee stock ownership plan and, if you choose, through any direct stock you purchase. You can take pride in joining an organization that prioritizes clinical quality in all decision-making, utilizing the expertise of an esteemed and expansive Clinical Committee. As a dentist, you will get the support, mentoring and guidance needed to provide excellent care for your patients and growth in your career.  And, to help make the transition easier, we’re offering a minimum sign-on bonus of $20,000.

Mortenson Dental Partners is one of the largest groups of employee-owned dental practices in the United States, with over 140 practices across nine states, over 1,800 team members and nearly one million patient visits each year. Unlike most dental support organizations, we are completely employee owned, with absolutely no private equity. Each location feels like a private practice but enjoys the support of a large organization. We empower our team members to think like owners and make the best decisions for their team, patients and practice.
Our values were built on a foundation of love for one another, regardless of race, color, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, religion or other attributes.

You’ll also immediately be an owner in our organization through our employee stock ownership plan and, if you choose, through any direct stock you purchase. You can take pride in joining an organization that prioritizes clinical quality in all decision-making, utilizing the expertise of an esteemed and expansive Clinical Committee. As a dentist, you will get the support, mentoring and guidance needed to provide excellent care for your patients and growth in your career.  And, to help make the transition easier, we’re offering a minimum sign-on bonus of $20,000.
